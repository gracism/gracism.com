<p>This page is just getting started, but here are some songs that I feel express 
some thoughts that go well with Gracism. Now, with any song, the lyrics frequently 
cover a lot of ground, and are subject to interpretation. But I find these 
songs to be encouraging. Take the parts that encourage you to heart.</p>

<p>And yes, it's just a conincidence that both of them are country western
 songs. And that they both deal with dancing. Ok, that probably isn't a coincidence.
