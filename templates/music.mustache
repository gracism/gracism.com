    <h2>Musical Inspiration</h2>
    
    <p>This page is just getting started, but here are some songs that I feel express some thoughts that go well with Gracism. Now, with any song, the lyrics frequently cover a lot of ground, and are subject to interpretation. But I find these songs to be encouraging. Take the parts that encourage you to heart.</p>

    <p>And yes, it's just a coincidence that both of them are country western songs. And that they both deal with dancing. Ok, that probably isn't a coincidence.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic;">The lyrics can be found with most any search engine, just by typing in the title and artist's name.</p>
